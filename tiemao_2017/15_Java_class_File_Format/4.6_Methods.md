## 4.6. Methods

Each method, including each instance initialization method ([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)) and the class or interface initialization method ([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)), is described by a `method_info` structure.

No two methods in one `class` file may have the same name and descriptor ([§4.3.3](#jvms-4.3.3)).

The structure has the following format:

```
method_info {
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             name_index;
    u2             descriptor_index;
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}

```

The items of the `method_info` structure are as follows:

- access_flags

  The value of the `access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permission to and properties of this method. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is specified in [Table 4.6-A](#jvms-4.6-200-A.1).**Table 4.6-A. Method access and property flags**Flag NameValueInterpretation`ACC_PUBLIC`0x0001Declared `public`; may be accessed from outside its package.`ACC_PRIVATE`0x0002Declared `private`; accessible only within the defining class.`ACC_PROTECTED`0x0004Declared `protected`; may be accessed within subclasses.`ACC_STATIC`0x0008Declared `static`.`ACC_FINAL`0x0010Declared `final`; must not be overridden ([§5.4.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.5)).`ACC_SYNCHRONIZED`0x0020Declared `synchronized`; invocation is wrapped by a monitor use.`ACC_BRIDGE`0x0040A bridge method, generated by the compiler.`ACC_VARARGS`0x0080Declared with variable number of arguments.`ACC_NATIVE`0x0100Declared `native`; implemented in a language other than Java.`ACC_ABSTRACT`0x0400Declared `abstract`; no implementation is provided.`ACC_STRICT`0x0800Declared `strictfp`; floating-point mode is FP-strict.`ACC_SYNTHETIC`0x1000Declared synthetic; not present in the source code.Methods of classes may have any of the flags in [Table 4.6-A](#jvms-4.6-200-A.1) set. However, each method of a class may have at most one of its `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PRIVATE`, and `ACC_PROTECTED`flags set (JLS §8.4.3).Methods of interfaces may have any of the flags in [Table 4.6-A](#jvms-4.6-200-A.1) set except `ACC_PROTECTED`, `ACC_FINAL`, `ACC_SYNCHRONIZED`, and `ACC_NATIVE` (JLS §9.4). In a `class` file whose version number is less than 52.0, each method of an interface must have its `ACC_PUBLIC` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags set; in a `class` file whose version number is 52.0 or above, each method of an interface must have exactly one of its `ACC_PUBLIC` and `ACC_PRIVATE` flags set.If a method of a class or interface has its `ACC_ABSTRACT` flag set, it must not have any of its `ACC_PRIVATE`, `ACC_STATIC`, `ACC_FINAL`, `ACC_SYNCHRONIZED`, `ACC_NATIVE`, or `ACC_STRICT`flags set.Each instance initialization method ([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)) may have at most one of its `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PRIVATE`, and `ACC_PROTECTED` flags set, and may also have its `ACC_VARARGS`, `ACC_STRICT`, and `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flags set, but must not have any of the other flags in [Table 4.6-A](#jvms-4.6-200-A.1) set.Class and interface initialization methods are called implicitly by the Java Virtual Machine. The value of their `access_flags` item is ignored except for the setting of the `ACC_STRICT` flag.The `ACC_BRIDGE` flag is used to indicate a bridge method generated by a compiler for the Java programming language.The `ACC_VARARGS` flag indicates that this method takes a variable number of arguments at the source code level. A method declared to take a variable number of arguments must be compiled with the `ACC_VARARGS` flag set to 1. All other methods must be compiled with the `ACC_VARARGS` flag set to 0.The `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag indicates that this method was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code, unless it is one of the methods named in [§4.7.8](#jvms-4.7.8).All bits of the `access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.6-A](#jvms-4.6-200-A.1) are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

- name_index

  The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](#jvms-4.4.7)) representing either one of the special method names `<init>` or `<clinit>` ([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)), or a valid unqualified name denoting a method ([§4.2.2](#jvms-4.2.2)).

- descriptor_index

  The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a valid method descriptor ([§4.3.3](#jvms-4.3.3)).A future edition of this specification may require that the last parameter descriptor of the method descriptor is an array type if the `ACC_VARARGS` flag is set in the `access_flags`item.

- attributes_count

  The value of the `attributes_count` item indicates the number of additional attributes of this method.

- attributes[]

  Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](#jvms-4.7)).A method can have any number of optional attributes associated with it.The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](#jvms-4.7-320).The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure are given in [§4.7](#jvms-4.7).The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure are given in [§4.7.1](#jvms-4.7.1).
