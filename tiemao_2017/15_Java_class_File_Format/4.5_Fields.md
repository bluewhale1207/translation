## 4.5. Fields

Each field is described by a `field_info` structure.

No two fields in one `class` file may have the same name and descriptor ([§4.3.2](#jvms-4.3.2)).

The structure has the following format:

```
field_info {
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             name_index;
    u2             descriptor_index;
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}

```

The items of the `field_info` structure are as follows:

- access_flags

  The value of the `access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permission to and properties of this field. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is specified in [Table 4.5-A](#jvms-4.5-200-A.1).**Table 4.5-A. Field access and property flags**Flag NameValueInterpretation`ACC_PUBLIC`0x0001Declared `public`; may be accessed from outside its package.`ACC_PRIVATE`0x0002Declared `private`; usable only within the defining class.`ACC_PROTECTED`0x0004Declared `protected`; may be accessed within subclasses.`ACC_STATIC`0x0008Declared `static`.`ACC_FINAL`0x0010Declared `final`; never directly assigned to after object construction (JLS §17.5).`ACC_VOLATILE`0x0040Declared `volatile`; cannot be cached.`ACC_TRANSIENT`0x0080Declared `transient`; not written or read by a persistent object manager.`ACC_SYNTHETIC`0x1000Declared synthetic; not present in the source code.`ACC_ENUM`0x4000Declared as an element of an `enum`.Fields of classes may set any of the flags in [Table 4.5-A](#jvms-4.5-200-A.1). However, each field of a class may have at most one of its `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PRIVATE`, and `ACC_PROTECTED` flags set (JLS §8.3.1), and must not have both its `ACC_FINAL` and `ACC_VOLATILE` flags set (JLS §8.3.1.4).Fields of interfaces must have their `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_STATIC`, and `ACC_FINAL` flags set; they may have their `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag set and must not have any of the other flags in [Table 4.5-A](#jvms-4.5-200-A.1) set (JLS §9.3).The `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag indicates that this field was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code.The `ACC_ENUM` flag indicates that this field is used to hold an element of an enumerated type.All bits of the `access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.5-A](#jvms-4.5-200-A.1) are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

- name_index

  The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](#jvms-4.4.7)) which represents a valid unqualified name denoting a field ([§4.2.2](#jvms-4.2.2)).

- descriptor_index

  The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](#jvms-4.4.7)) which represents a valid field descriptor ([§4.3.2](#jvms-4.3.2)).

- attributes_count

  The value of the `attributes_count` item indicates the number of additional attributes of this field.

- attributes[]

  Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](#jvms-4.7)).A field can have any number of optional attributes associated with it.The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](#jvms-4.7-320).The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure are given in [§4.7](#jvms-4.7).The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure are given in [§4.7.1](#jvms-4.7.1).
