#### 4.10.1.6. Type Checking Methods with Code

Non-`abstract`, non-`native` methods are type correct if they have code and the code is type correct.

```
methodIsTypeSafe(Class, Method) :-
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(Class, Method),
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    methodAttributes(Method, Attributes),
    notMember(native, AccessFlags),
    notMember(abstract, AccessFlags),
    member(attribute('Code', _), Attributes),
    methodWithCodeIsTypeSafe(Class, Method).

```

A method with code is type safe if it is possible to merge the code and the stack map frames into a single stream such that each stack map frame precedes the instruction it corresponds to, and the merged stream is type correct. The method's exception handlers, if any, must also be legal.

```
methodWithCodeIsTypeSafe(Class, Method) :-
    parseCodeAttribute(Class, Method, FrameSize, MaxStack,
                       ParsedCode, Handlers, StackMap),
    mergeStackMapAndCode(StackMap, ParsedCode, MergedCode),
    methodInitialStackFrame(Class, Method, FrameSize, StackFrame, ReturnType),
    Environment = environment(Class, Method, ReturnType, MergedCode,
                              MaxStack, Handlers),
    handlersAreLegal(Environment),
    mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MergedCode, StackFrame).

```

Let us consider exception handlers first.

An exception handler is represented by a functor application of the form:

```
handler(Start, End, Target, ClassName)

```

whose arguments are, respectively, the start and end of the range of instructions covered by the handler, the first instruction of the handler code, and the name of the exception class that this handler is designed to handle.

An exception handler is *legal* if its start (`Start`) is less than its end (`End`), there exists an instruction whose offset is equal to `Start`, there exists an instruction whose offset equals `End`, and the handler's exception class is assignable to the class `Throwable`. The exception class of a handler is `Throwable` if the handler's class entry is 0, otherwise it is the class named in the handler.

An additional requirement exists for a handler inside an `<init>` method if one of the instructions covered by the handler is *invokespecial* of an `<init>` method. In this case, the fact that a handler is running means the object under construction is likely broken, so it is important that the handler does not swallow the exception and allow the enclosing `<init>` method to return normally to the caller. Accordingly, the handler is required to either complete abruptly by throwing an exception to the caller of the enclosing `<init>` method, or to loop forever.

```
handlersAreLegal(Environment) :-
    exceptionHandlers(Environment, Handlers),
    checklist(handlerIsLegal(Environment), Handlers).

handlerIsLegal(Environment, Handler) :-
    Handler = handler(Start, End, Target, _),
    Start < End,
    allInstructions(Environment, Instructions),
    member(instruction(Start, _), Instructions),
    offsetStackFrame(Environment, Target, _),
    instructionsIncludeEnd(Instructions, End),
    currentClassLoader(Environment, CurrentLoader),
    handlerExceptionClass(Handler, ExceptionClass, CurrentLoader), 
    isBootstrapLoader(BL),
    isAssignable(ExceptionClass, class('java/lang/Throwable', BL)),
    initHandlerIsLegal(Environment, Handler).

instructionsIncludeEnd(Instructions, End) :-
    member(instruction(End, _), Instructions).
instructionsIncludeEnd(Instructions, End) :-
    member(endOfCode(End), Instructions).

handlerExceptionClass(handler(_, _, _, 0),
                      class('java/lang/Throwable', BL), _) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

handlerExceptionClass(handler(_, _, _, Name),
                      class(Name, L), L) :-
    Name \= 0.

```

```
initHandlerIsLegal(Environment, Handler) :-
    notInitHandler(Environment, Handler).

notInitHandler(Environment, Handler) :-
    Environment = environment(_Class, Method, _, Instructions, _, _),
    isNotInit(Method).

notInitHandler(Environment, Handler) :-
    Environment = environment(_Class, Method, _, Instructions, _, _),
    isInit(Method),
    member(instruction(_, invokespecial(CP)), Instructions),
    CP = method(MethodClassName, MethodName, Descriptor),
    MethodName \= '<init>'. 


initHandlerIsLegal(Environment, Handler) :-
    isInitHandler(Environment, Handler),
    sublist(isApplicableInstruction(Target), Instructions,
            HandlerInstructions),
    noAttemptToReturnNormally(HandlerInstructions).

isInitHandler(Environment, Handler) :-
    Environment = environment(_Class, Method, _, Instructions, _, _),
    isInit(Method).
    member(instruction(_, invokespecial(CP)), Instructions),
    CP = method(MethodClassName, '<init>', Descriptor).

isApplicableInstruction(HandlerStart, instruction(Offset, _)) :-
    Offset >= HandlerStart.

noAttemptToReturnNormally(Instructions) :-
    notMember(instruction(_, return), Instructions).

noAttemptToReturnNormally(Instructions) :-
    member(instruction(_, athrow), Instructions). 

```

Let us now turn to the stream of instructions and stack map frames.

Merging instructions and stack map frames into a single stream involves four cases:

- Merging an empty `StackMap` and a list of instructions yields the original list of instructions.

  ```
  mergeStackMapAndCode([], CodeList, CodeList).

  ```

- Given a list of stack map frames beginning with the type state for the instruction at `Offset`, and a list of instructions beginning at `Offset`, the merged list is the head of the stack map frame list, followed by the head of the instruction list, followed by the merge of the tails of the two lists.

  ```
  mergeStackMapAndCode([stackMap(Offset, Map) | RestMap],
                       [instruction(Offset, Parse) | RestCode],
                       [stackMap(Offset, Map),
                         instruction(Offset, Parse) | RestMerge]) :-
      mergeStackMapAndCode(RestMap, RestCode, RestMerge).

  ```

- Otherwise, given a list of stack map frames beginning with the type state for the instruction at `OffsetM`, and a list of instructions beginning at `OffsetP`, then, if `OffsetP < OffsetM`, the merged list consists of the head of the instruction list, followed by the merge of the stack map frame list and the tail of the instruction list.

  ```
  mergeStackMapAndCode([stackMap(OffsetM, Map) | RestMap],
                       [instruction(OffsetP, Parse) | RestCode],
                       [instruction(OffsetP, Parse) | RestMerge]) :-
      OffsetP < OffsetM,
      mergeStackMapAndCode([stackMap(OffsetM, Map) | RestMap],
                           RestCode, RestMerge).

  ```

- Otherwise, the merge of the two lists is undefined. Since the instruction list has monotonically increasing offsets, the merge of the two lists is not defined unless every stack map frame offset has a corresponding instruction offset and the stack map frames are in monotonically increasing order.

To determine if the merged stream for a method is type correct, we first infer the method's initial type state.

The initial type state of a method consists of an empty operand stack and local variable types derived from the type of `this` and the arguments, as well as the appropriate flag, depending on whether this is an `<init>` method.

```
methodInitialStackFrame(Class, Method, FrameSize, frame(Locals, [], Flags),
                        ReturnType):-
    methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor),
    parseMethodDescriptor(Descriptor, RawArgs, ReturnType),
    expandTypeList(RawArgs, Args),
    methodInitialThisType(Class, Method, ThisList),
    flags(ThisList, Flags),
    append(ThisList, Args, ThisArgs),
    expandToLength(ThisArgs, FrameSize, top, Locals).

```

Given a list of types, the following clause produces a list where every type of size 2 has been substituted by two entries: one for itself, and one `top` entry. The result then corresponds to the representation of the list as 32-bit words in the Java Virtual Machine.

```
expandTypeList([], []).
expandTypeList([Item | List], [Item | Result]) :-
    sizeOf(Item, 1),
    expandTypeList(List, Result).
expandTypeList([Item | List], [Item, top | Result]) :-
    sizeOf(Item, 2),
    expandTypeList(List, Result).

```

```
flags([uninitializedThis], [flagThisUninit]).
flags(X, []) :- X \= [uninitializedThis].

expandToLength(List, Size, _Filler, List) :-
    length(List, Size).
expandToLength(List, Size, Filler, Result) :-
    length(List, ListLength),
    ListLength < Size,
    Delta is Size - ListLength,
    length(Extra, Delta),
    checklist(=(Filler), Extra),
    append(List, Extra, Result).

```

For the initial type state of an instance method, we compute the type of `this` and put it in a list. The type of `this` in the `<init>` method of `Object` is `Object`; in other `<init>` methods, the type of `this` is `uninitializedThis`; otherwise, the type of `this` in an instance method is `class(N, L)` where `N` is the name of the class containing the method and `L` is its defining class loader.

For the initial type state of a static method, `this` is irrelevant, so the list is empty.

```
methodInitialThisType(_Class, Method, []) :-
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    member(static, AccessFlags),
    methodName(Method, MethodName),
    MethodName \= '<init>'.

methodInitialThisType(Class, Method, [This]) :-
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    notMember(static, AccessFlags),
    instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, This).

instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, class('java/lang/Object', L)) :-
    methodName(Method, '<init>'), 
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    isBootstrapLoader(L),
    classClassName(Class, 'java/lang/Object').

instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, uninitializedThis) :-
    methodName(Method, '<init>'), 
    classClassName(Class, ClassName),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, CurrentLoader),
    superclassChain(ClassName, CurrentLoader, Chain),
    Chain \= [].

instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, class(ClassName, L)) :-
    methodName(Method, MethodName),
    MethodName \= '<init>',
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    classClassName(Class, ClassName).

```

We now compute whether the merged stream for a method is type correct, using the method's initial type state:

- If we have a stack map frame and an incoming type state, the type state must be assignable to the one in the stack map frame. We may then proceed to type check the rest of the stream with the type state given in the stack map frame.

  ```
  mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, [stackMap(Offset, MapFrame) | MoreCode],
                       frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags)) :-
      frameIsAssignable(frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags), MapFrame),
      mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MoreCode, MapFrame).

  ```

- A merged code stream is type safe relative to an incoming type state `T` if it begins with an instruction `I` that is type safe relative to `T`, and `I` *satisfies* its exception handlers (see below), and the tail of the stream is type safe given the type state following that execution of `I`.

  `NextStackFrame` indicates what falls through to the following instruction. For an unconditional branch instruction, it will have the special value `afterGoto`. `ExceptionStackFrame`indicates what is passed to exception handlers.

  ```
  mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, [instruction(Offset, Parse) | MoreCode],
                       frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags)) :-
      instructionIsTypeSafe(Parse, Environment, Offset,
                            frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags),
                            NextStackFrame, ExceptionStackFrame),
      instructionSatisfiesHandlers(Environment, Offset, ExceptionStackFrame),
      mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MoreCode, NextStackFrame).

  ```

- After an unconditional branch (indicated by an incoming type state of `afterGoto`), if we have a stack map frame giving the type state for the following instructions, we can proceed and type check them using the type state provided by the stack map frame.

  ```
  mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, [stackMap(Offset, MapFrame) | MoreCode],
                       afterGoto) :-
      mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MoreCode, MapFrame).

  ```

- It is illegal to have code after an unconditional branch without a stack map frame being provided for it.

  ```
  mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(_Environment, [instruction(_, _) | _MoreCode],
                       afterGoto) :-
      write_ln('No stack frame after unconditional branch'),
      fail.

  ```

- If we have an unconditional branch at the end of the code, stop.

  ```
  mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(_Environment, [endOfCode(Offset)],
                       afterGoto).

  ```

Branching to a target is type safe if the target has an associated stack frame, `Frame`, and the current stack frame, `StackFrame`, is assignable to `Frame`.

```
targetIsTypeSafe(Environment, StackFrame, Target) :-
    offsetStackFrame(Environment, Target, Frame),
    frameIsAssignable(StackFrame, Frame).

```

An instruction *satisfies its exception handlers* if it satisfies every exception handler that is applicable to the instruction.

```
instructionSatisfiesHandlers(Environment, Offset, ExceptionStackFrame) :-
    exceptionHandlers(Environment, Handlers),
    sublist(isApplicableHandler(Offset), Handlers, ApplicableHandlers),
    checklist(instructionSatisfiesHandler(Environment, ExceptionStackFrame),
              ApplicableHandlers).

```

An exception handler is *applicable* to an instruction if the offset of the instruction is greater or equal to the start of the handler's range and less than the end of the handler's range.

```
isApplicableHandler(Offset, handler(Start, End, _Target, _ClassName)) :-
    Offset >= Start,
    Offset < End.

```

An instruction *satisfies* an exception handler if the instructions's outgoing type state is `ExcStackFrame`, and the handler's target (the initial instruction of the handler code) is type safe assuming an incoming type state `T`. The type state `T` is derived from `ExcStackFrame` by replacing the operand stack with a stack whose sole element is the handler's exception class.

```
instructionSatisfiesHandler(Environment, ExcStackFrame, Handler) :-
    Handler = handler(_, _, Target, _),
    currentClassLoader(Environment, CurrentLoader),
    handlerExceptionClass(Handler, ExceptionClass, CurrentLoader), 
    /* The stack consists of just the exception. */
    ExcStackFrame = frame(Locals, _, Flags),
    TrueExcStackFrame = frame(Locals, [ ExceptionClass ], Flags),
    operandStackHasLegalLength(Environment, TrueExcStackFrame),
    targetIsTypeSafe(Environment, TrueExcStackFrame, Target).

```
