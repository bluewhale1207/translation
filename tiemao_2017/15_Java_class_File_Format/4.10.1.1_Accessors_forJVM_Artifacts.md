#### 4.10.1.1. Accessors for Java Virtual Machine Artifacts

We stipulate the existence of 28 Prolog predicates ("accessors") that have certain expected behavior but whose formal definitions are not given in this specification.

- classClassName(Class, ClassName)

  Extracts the name, `ClassName`, of the class `Class`.

- classIsInterface(Class)

  True iff the class, `Class`, is an interface.

- classIsNotFinal(Class)

  True iff the class, `Class`, is not a `final` class.

- classSuperClassName(Class, SuperClassName)

  Extracts the name, `SuperClassName`, of the superclass of class `Class`.

- classInterfaces(Class, Interfaces)

  Extracts a list, `Interfaces`, of the direct superinterfaces of the class `Class`.

- classMethods(Class, Methods)

  Extracts a list, `Methods`, of the methods declared in the class `Class`.

- classAttributes(Class, Attributes)

  Extracts a list, `Attributes`, of the attributes of the class `Class`.Each attribute is represented as a functor application of the form `attribute(AttributeName, AttributeContents)`, where `AttributeName` is the name of the attribute. The format of the attribute's contents is unspecified.

- classDefiningLoader(Class, Loader)

  Extracts the defining class loader, `Loader`, of the class `Class`.

  True iff the class loader `Loader` is the bootstrap class loader.

- loadedClass(Name, InitiatingLoader, ClassDefinition)

- methodName(Method, Name)

  Extracts the name, `Name`, of the method `Method`.

- methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags)

  Extracts the access flags, `AccessFlags`, of the method `Method`.

- methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor)

  Extracts the descriptor, `Descriptor`, of the method `Method`.

- methodAttributes(Method, Attributes)

  Extracts a list, `Attributes`, of the attributes of the method `Method`.

- isInit(Method)

  True iff `Method` (regardless of class) is `<init>`.

- isNotInit(Method)

  True iff `Method` (regardless of class) is not `<init>`.

- isNotFinal(Method, Class)

  True iff `Method` in class `Class` is not `final`.

- isStatic(Method, Class)

  True iff `Method` in class `Class` is `static`.

- isNotStatic(Method, Class)

  True iff `Method` in class `Class` is not `static`.

- isPrivate(Method, Class)

  True iff `Method` in class `Class` is `private`.

- isNotPrivate(Method, Class)

  True iff `Method` in class `Class` is not `private`.

- isProtected(MemberClass, MemberName, MemberDescriptor)

  True iff there is a member named `MemberName` with descriptor `MemberDescriptor` in the class `MemberClass` and it is `protected`.

- isNotProtected(MemberClass, MemberName, MemberDescriptor)

  True iff there is a member named `MemberName` with descriptor `MemberDescriptor` in the class `MemberClass` and it is not `protected`.

- parseFieldDescriptor(Descriptor, Type)

  Converts a field descriptor, `Descriptor`, into the corresponding verification type `Type` ([ยง4.10.1.2](#jvms-4.10.1.2)).

- parseMethodDescriptor(Descriptor, ArgTypeList, ReturnType)

  Converts a method descriptor, `Descriptor`, into a list of verification types, `ArgTypeList`, corresponding to the method argument types, and a verification type, `ReturnType`, corresponding to the return type.

- parseCodeAttribute(Class, Method, FrameSize, MaxStack, ParsedCode, Handlers, StackMap)

  Extracts the instruction stream, `ParsedCode`, of the method `Method` in `Class`, as well as the maximum operand stack size, `MaxStack`, the maximal number of local variables, `FrameSize`, the exception handlers, `Handlers`, and the stack map `StackMap`.The representation of the instruction stream and stack map attribute must be as specified in [ยง4.10.1.3](#jvms-4.10.1.3) and [ยง4.10.1.4](#jvms-4.10.1.4).

- samePackageName(Class1, Class2)

  True iff the package names of `Class1` and `Class2` are the same.

- differentPackageName(Class1, Class2)

  True iff the package names of `Class1` and `Class2` are different.

When type checking a method's body, it is convenient to access information about the method. For this purpose, we define an *environment*, a six-tuple consisting of:

- a class
- a method
- the declared return type of the method
- the instructions in a method
- the maximal size of the operand stack
- a list of exception handlers

We specify accessors to extract information from the environment.

```
allInstructions(Environment, Instructions) :-
    Environment = environment(_Class, _Method, _ReturnType,
                              Instructions, _, _).

exceptionHandlers(Environment, Handlers) :-
    Environment = environment(_Class, _Method, _ReturnType,
                              _Instructions, _, Handlers).

maxOperandStackLength(Environment, MaxStack) :-
    Environment = environment(_Class, _Method, _ReturnType,
                              _Instructions, MaxStack, _Handlers).

thisClass(Environment, class(ClassName, L)) :-
    Environment = environment(Class, _Method, _ReturnType,
                              _Instructions, _, _),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    classClassName(Class, ClassName).

thisMethodReturnType(Environment, ReturnType) :-
    Environment = environment(_Class, _Method, ReturnType,
                              _Instructions, _, _).

```

We specify additional predicates to extract higher-level information from the environment.

```
offsetStackFrame(Environment, Offset, StackFrame) :-
    allInstructions(Environment, Instructions),
    member(stackMap(Offset, StackFrame), Instructions).

currentClassLoader(Environment, Loader) :-
    thisClass(Environment, class(_, Loader)).

```

Finally, we specify a general predicate used throughout the type rules:

```
notMember(_, []).
notMember(X, [A | More]) :- X \= A, notMember(X, More).

```

The principle guiding the determination as to which accessors are stipulated and which are fully specified is that we do not want to over-specify the representation of the `class` file. Providing specific accessors to the `Class` or `Method` term would force us to completely specify the format for a Prolog term representing the `class` file.

#### 4.10.1.2. Verification Type System

The type checker enforces a type system based upon a hierarchy of *verification types*, illustrated below.

```
Verification type hierarchy:

                             top
                 ____________/\____________
                /                          \
               /                            \
            oneWord                       twoWord
           /   |   \                     /       \
          /    |    \                   /         \
        int  float  reference        long        double
                     /     \
                    /       \_____________
                   /                      \
                  /                        \
           uninitialized                    +------------------+
            /         \                     |  Java reference  |
           /           \                    |  type hierarchy  |
uninitializedThis  uninitialized(Offset)    +------------------+  
                                                     |
                                                     |
                                                    null

```

Most verification types have a direct correspondence with the primitive and reference types represented by field descriptors in [Table 4.3-A](#jvms-4.3.2-200):

- The primitive types `double`, `float`, `int`, and `long` (field descriptors `D`, `F`, `I`, `J`) each correspond to the verification type of the same name.

- The primitive types `byte`, `char`, `short`, and `boolean` (field descriptors `B`, `C`, `S`, `Z`) all correspond to the verification type `int`.

- Class and interface types correspond to verification types that use the functor `class`. The verification type `class(*N*, *L*)` represents the class whose binary name is `*N*` as loaded by the loader `*L*`. Note that `*L*` is an initiating loader ([ยง5.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3)) of the class represented by `class(*N*, *L*)` and may, or may not, be the class's defining loader.

  For example, the class type `Object` would be represented as `class('java/lang/Object', BL)`, where `BL` is the bootstrap loader.

- Array types correspond to verification types that use the functor `arrayOf`. The verification type `arrayOf(*T*)` represents the array type whose component type is the verification type `*T*`.

  For example, the types `int[]` and `Object[]` would be represented by `arrayOf(int)` and `arrayOf(class('java/lang/Object', BL))` respectively.

The verification type `uninitialized(Offset)` is represented by applying the functor `uninitialized` to an argument representing the numerical value of the `Offset`.

Other verification types are represented in Prolog as atoms whose name denotes the verification type in question.

The subtyping rules for verification types are as follows.

Subtyping is reflexive.

```
isAssignable(X, X).

```

The verification types which are not reference types in the Java programming language have subtype rules of the form:

```
isAssignable(v, X) :- isAssignable(the_direct_supertype_of_v, X).

```

That is, `v` is a subtype of `X` if the direct supertype of `v` is a subtype of `X`. The rules are:

```
isAssignable(oneWord, top).
isAssignable(twoWord, top).

isAssignable(int, X)    :- isAssignable(oneWord, X).
isAssignable(float, X)  :- isAssignable(oneWord, X).
isAssignable(long, X)   :- isAssignable(twoWord, X).
isAssignable(double, X) :- isAssignable(twoWord, X).

isAssignable(reference, X)   :- isAssignable(oneWord, X).
isAssignable(class(_, _), X) :- isAssignable(reference, X).
isAssignable(arrayOf(_), X)  :- isAssignable(reference, X).

isAssignable(uninitialized, X)     :- isAssignable(reference, X).
isAssignable(uninitializedThis, X) :- isAssignable(uninitialized, X).
isAssignable(uninitialized(_), X)  :- isAssignable(uninitialized, X).

isAssignable(null, class(_, _)).
isAssignable(null, arrayOf(_)).
isAssignable(null, X) :- isAssignable(class('java/lang/Object', BL), X),
                         isBootstrapLoader(BL).

```

These subtype rules are not necessarily the most obvious formulation of subtyping. There is a clear split between subtyping rules for reference types in the Java programming language, and rules for the remaining verification types. The split allows us to state general subtyping relations between Java programming language reference types and other verification types. These relations hold independently of a Java reference type's position in the type hierarchy, and help to prevent excessive class loading by a Java Virtual Machine implementation. For example, we do not want to start climbing the Java superclass hierarchy in response to a query of the form `class(foo, L) <: twoWord`.

We also have a rule that says subtyping is reflexive, so together these rules cover most verification types that are not reference types in the Java programming language.

Subtype rules for the reference types in the Java programming language are specified recursively with `isJavaAssignable`.

```
isAssignable(class(X, Lx), class(Y, Ly)) :-
    isJavaAssignable(class(X, Lx), class(Y, Ly)).

isAssignable(arrayOf(X), class(Y, L)) :-
    isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), class(Y, L)).

isAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)) :-
    isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)).

```

For assignments, interfaces are treated like `Object`.

```
isJavaAssignable(class(_, _), class(To, L)) :-
    loadedClass(To, L, ToClass),
    classIsInterface(ToClass).

isJavaAssignable(From, To) :-
    isJavaSubclassOf(From, To).

```

Array types are subtypes of `Object`. The intent is also that array types are subtypes of `Cloneable` and `java.io.Serializable`.

```
isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(_), class('java/lang/Object', BL)) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(_), X) :-
    isArrayInterface(X).

isArrayInterface(class('java/lang/Cloneable', BL)) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

isArrayInterface(class('java/io/Serializable', BL)) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

```

Subtyping between arrays of primitive type is the identity relation.

```
isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)) :-
    atom(X),
    atom(Y),
    X = Y.

```

Subtyping between arrays of reference type is covariant.

```
isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)) :-
    compound(X), compound(Y), isJavaAssignable(X, Y).

```

Subclassing is reflexive.

```
isJavaSubclassOf(class(SubclassName, L), class(SubclassName, L)).

```

```
isJavaSubclassOf(class(SubclassName, LSub), class(SuperclassName, LSuper)) :-
    superclassChain(SubclassName, LSub, Chain),
    member(class(SuperclassName, L), Chain),
    loadedClass(SuperclassName, L, Sup),
    loadedClass(SuperclassName, LSuper, Sup).

superclassChain(ClassName, L, [class(SuperclassName, Ls) | Rest]) :-
    loadedClass(ClassName, L, Class),
    classSuperClassName(Class, SuperclassName),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, Ls),
    superclassChain(SuperclassName, Ls, Rest).

superclassChain('java/lang/Object', L, []) :-
    loadedClass('java/lang/Object', L, Class),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, BL),
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

```

#### 4.10.1.3. Instruction Representation

Individual bytecode instructions are represented in Prolog as terms whose functor is the name of the instruction and whose arguments are its parsed operands.

For example, an *aload* instruction is represented as the term `aload(N)`, which includes the index `N` that is the operand of the instruction.

The instructions as a whole are represented as a list of terms of the form:

```
instruction(Offset, AnInstruction)

```

For example, `instruction(21, aload(1))`.

The order of instructions in this list must be the same as in the `class` file.

A few instructions have operands that are constant pool entries representing fields, methods, and dynamic call sites. In the constant pool, a field is represented by a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure, a method is represented by a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure (for an interface's method) or a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure (for a class's method), and a dynamic call site is represented by a `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure ([ยง4.4.2](#jvms-4.4.2), [ยง4.4.10](#jvms-4.4.10)). Such structures are represented as functor applications of the form:

- `field(FieldClassName, FieldName, FieldDescriptor)` for a field, where `FieldClassName` is the name of the class referenced by the `class_index` item in the`CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure, and `FieldName` and `FieldDescriptor` correspond to the name and field descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the`CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure.
- `imethod(MethodIntfName, MethodName, MethodDescriptor)` for an interface's method, where `MethodIntfName` is the name of the interface referenced by the `class_index` item of the `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure, and `MethodName` and `MethodDescriptor` correspond to the name and method descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure;
- `method(MethodClassName, MethodName, MethodDescriptor)` for a class's method, where `MethodClassName` is the name of the class referenced by the `class_index` item of the `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure, and `MethodName` and `MethodDescriptor` correspond to the name and method descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the`CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure; and
- `dmethod(CallSiteName, MethodDescriptor)` for a dynamic call site, where `CallSiteName` and `MethodDescriptor` correspond to the name and method descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure.

For clarity, we assume that field and method descriptors ([ยง4.3.2](#jvms-4.3.2), [ยง4.3.3](#jvms-4.3.3)) are mapped into more readable names: the leading `L` and trailing `;` are dropped from class names, and the *BaseType* characters used for primitive types are mapped to the names of those types.

For example, a *getfield* instruction whose operand was an index into the constant pool that refers to a field `foo` of type `F` in class `Bar` would be represented as `getfield(field('Bar', 'foo', 'F'))`.

Constant pool entries that refer to constant values, such as `CONSTANT_String`, `CONSTANT_Integer`, `CONSTANT_Float`, `CONSTANT_Long`, `CONSTANT_Double`, and `CONSTANT_Class`, are encoded via the functors whose names are `string`, `int`, `float`, `long`, `double`, and `classConstant` respectively.

For example, an *ldc* instruction for loading the integer 91 would be encoded as `ldc(int(91))`.
