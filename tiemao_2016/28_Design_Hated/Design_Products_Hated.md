# How Do You Design Products to be Hated

**SitePoint Design**

As a designer, have you ever been asked to make something that people **_hate_**? Something designed to literally drive people away from a product?

I suspect not.

That's precisely the strange task that market research and UX research firm, [GfK](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-l-dkirdhy-jdiydklhii-i/) was set in 2012\. In Australia, smoking is so discouraged [legislation dictates](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-l-dkirdhy-jdiydklhii-u/) that the all cigarette packaging be deeply unattractive. This includes disturbing images of smoking-related illnesses.

Not that's it's _**100%**_ effective. I have male smoker friends who specifically ask for the 'Smoking can harm your pregnancy' boxes because the message doesn't apply to them (I'm serious).

GfK was commissioned to study 1,000 smokers to determine the world's most visually offensive color.

This is it - [Pantone 448C](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-l-dkirdhy-jdiydklhii-o/), also known by the more poetic name of 'opaque couché'. I'd call it a dark brown, leaning slightly into olive-green. GfK reported that smokers associated the color with "dirty", "death", and "tar".

## 
Can colors really be born bad?

Obviously, colors are just wavelengths of light, but we do have built-in reactions to them – some genetic, some learned.

Using Pantone 448C as the basis to create a montage of Flickr photos certainly [produces a gloomy, sickly collection](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-l-dkirdhy-jdiydklhii-b/).

There aren't many images with that color profile that fall under light-hearted or happy.

But, on the other hand, many designers have used the color (or one very close to it) with great success in the past.

Fashion megacorp Gucci currently offer a [£2,440 coat](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-l-dkirdhy-jdiydklhii-n/) they like to call 'thick army-green wool'. I'm afraid that is opaque couché, my friends.

Lots of logo designers (for instance, [Cog Design](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-l-dkirdhy-jdiydklhii-p/) above) have used the color the bring an earthy, anti-establishment cool. 

Da Vinci himself even used a palette of browny-green, couché-related colors throughout the background of the Mona Lisa.

## 
The Problem with Metallic Colors

The funny thing is, historically the two most common colors in Australian cigarette packaging design have been:

*   **Red**: signaling vigor and strength (i.e. Marlboro and Winfield)

*   **Gold**: signaling wealth and prestige (i.e. Marlboro Gold and Benson & Hedges)

Even the internal wrapper was often a gold-backed foil.

When you use any metallic card in packaging, its color naturally changes depending on where the light source is positioned – any color from a light, lemon yellow to a dark, deep chocolate.

And, yes, you guessed it – a color that reads as something very, very close to Pantone 448C.

Now, I see these new cigarette boxes quite often, and to me, they read visually as a metallic gold – just not quite catching the light. I know that's not the case, but with the shiny plastic wrappers, my brain just can't shake that idea.

So perhaps - given the specific history of cigarette packaging - a puke green or gangrenous pink might have been a better choice than a gold-hinting brown.

And maybe the surveyed smokers knew _exactly_ what they were doing?

So, how do _**you**_ feel about Pantone 448C?

Me, I don't hate the color. In fact, I'll be looking for design opportunities to slot it in.
