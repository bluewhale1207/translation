# noisy neighbor (cloud computing performance)

# 云计算性能 - 公有云中的坏邻居效应

> noisy neighbor effect, 坏邻居效应, 资源争抢



Noisy neighbor is a phrase used to describe a cloud computing infrastructure co-tenant that monopolizes bandwidth, disk I/O, CPU and other resources, and can negatively affect other users' cloud performance. The noisy neighbor effect causes other virtual machines and applications that share the infrastructure to suffer from uneven cloud network performance.

坏邻居(noisy neighbor)是云计算中的一个术语，用来描述有人挤占了公共的带宽,磁盘I/O、CPU以及其他共用资源, 并影响到其他用户的性能和体验. 坏邻居效应会引起其他共享基础设施的虚拟机和应用程序性能受到影响或抖动。


The cloud is a multi-tenant environment, which means that a single architecture hosts multiple customers' applications and data. The noisy neighbor effect occurs when an application or virtual machine uses the majority of available resources and causes network performance issues for others on the shared infrastructure.

云计算是一种多租户环境,这意味着一台物理主机会运行多个客户的应用和数据. 坏邻居效应发生的原因是某个应用或虚拟机占用了大部分的可用资源,并影响其他共享基础设施的客户的性能。


A lack of bandwidth is one cause of network performance issues. Bandwidth carries data throughout a network, so when one application or instance uses too much, other applications suffer from slow speeds or latency. Noisy neighbor can affect Web hosting, databases, networks, storage and servers.

带宽不足是网络性能问题的一个主要原因. 在网络中传输数据严重依赖带宽, 因此,当某个应用或实例占用太多,其他应用就会遭受缓慢或延迟. 坏邻居会影响虚拟主机、数据库、网络、存储和服务器。


One way to avoid the noisy neighbor effect is to use a bare-metal cloud. The bare-metal cloud runs one application at a time directly on the hardware, which creates a single-tenant environment and eliminates noisy neighbors. While single-tenant environments avoid the noisy neighbor effect, they do not solve the problem. Infrastructure over-commitment, or when an environment is shared by too many applications, limits overall cloud performance.

避免坏邻居效应的一种方法是使用裸机云(bare-metal cloud). 裸机云每次在硬件上直接运行一个应用, 相当于创建一个单租户环境,并消除了坏邻居。虽然单租户环境避免了坏邻居效应, 但并没有解决根本问题。基础设施超卖(over-commitment),或者某个环境由太多的应用共享,都会限制云的整体性能。



Another way to avoid noisy neighbors in the cloud is to ensure an application receives the necessary resources by moving workloads across physical servers. In addition, storage quality of service (QoS) controls a VM's input/output operations per second (IOPS), which can limit the noisy neighbor effect. Set IOPS limits can control the amount of resources each VM receives. Therefore, no single VM, application or instance monopolizes resources and hinders the performance of others.

在云中,另一种避免坏邻居效应的方法,是通过在物理机之间进行工作负载的迁移, 确保应用获得必要的资源. 此外, 服务的存储质量(QoS)控制VM每秒的输入/输出操作(IOPS), 可以限制坏邻居效应. 限制 IOPS 可以控制每个VM得到的资源量。因此,没有VM、应用或实例挤占和阻碍其他客户的资源和性能。

## Cloud storage providers moving to all-flash platform

> Colm Keegan explains why some cloud storage providers are moving to an all-flash platform and how bursting workloads into an all-flash cloud can reduce costs.

Cloud performance. It's perceived by many to be the soft underbelly of the cloud service provider industry. And it's one of the main reasons that businesses today are resisting the move to deploy their mission-critical applications into the cloud.

In this tip, you will learn what some cloud storage providers are doing to help guarantee application performance while mitigating the risk of resource contention within their multi-tenant infrastructures. You will also learn the types of questions you can ask a prospective cloud storage provider to see if it's up to the task of managing your business systems.

### All flash, all the time?

Some cloud storage providers have designed their [storage infrastructure](http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-storage-infrastructure)with all-flash storage arrays to, in effect, guarantee that all application workloads will have access to blazing-fast storage resources. But the obvious question is one of cost. Compared to conventional [hard disk drives](http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/hard-disk-drive)(HDDs), flash carries a significant premium. And if only a relatively small percentage of data needs flash access, isn't it likely that businesses would be overpaying for the luxury of deploying into an all-flash environment?

Interestingly, to attract clients that might otherwise be reluctant to commit to the higher premiums of operating in an [all-flash storage infrastructure](http://searchsolidstatestorage.techtarget.com/essentialguide/Flash-storage-Guide-to-enterprise-all-flash-storage-arrays); some cloud storage providers are offering flash capacity at the same cost as conventional HDD space. The provider, in effect, uses flash storage as a loss leader, then makes up for it in CPU consumption. So, those businesses running heavy application workloads in their cloud will accrue higher monthly costs than a business will that has sporadic application activity.

### **Noisy neighbor nuisance

While flash is capable of driving much higher I/O throughput rates than spinning media can, all-flash arrays are equally vulnerable to the [noisy neighbor](http://storageswiss.com/2013/12/20/what-is-a-noisy-neighbor/) issues that often plague heavily virtualized environments. A noisy neighbor is when a rogue virtual machine monopolizes the storage I/O resources to the performance detriment of the other VMs in the environment. To circumvent this problem, some cloud storage providers are deploying [all-flash arrays](http://searchsolidstatestorage.techtarget.com/definition/Flash-array), such as SolidFire's platform, that have built-in storage I/O quotas that can be set at an individual VM layer.

Large enterprise environments and cloud storage providers, in particular, need this level of management detail to ensure that storage I/O resources are assigned to those applications that have the highest demand for them. This can help ensure that each virtualized application tenant in the environment will always have access to a predetermined number of storage IOPS and prevent rogue VMs from upsetting the virtualized infrastructure applecart.

### **Variable service level support

These types of flash systems allow the provider to set up various service levels -- platinum, gold, silver, bronze, for example -- and then allocate resources based on the customer's application storage I/O throughput needs. But predicting application performance needs can be an inexact science. As is stated in any financial prospectus, past performance is no indicator of what future performance will be. So, a good question to ask a prospective cloud storage provider is whether they can dynamically handle moving between various service levels on the fly. In other words, if your application is set to a gold service level and is assigned a fixed number of IOPS, what happens when performance spikes and you need to suddenly change to a platinum service level? Likewise, how can you drop back down to gold or silver, when application performance demands vacillate over time?

### **Testing the waters

Some of the early adopters of heavy computational workload computing in the cloud are big governmental and scientific agencies that need auxiliary computing and storage space to process enormous volumes of data. Think of the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, where simulations of the Big Bang are taking place. Processing the output from these experiments requires enormous computational power and as a result, institutions like these are bursting workloads into the cloud to help speed the time it takes to process the output from these experiments.

Bursting application workloads into the cloud is a good way for businesses to test-drive cloud application provider services. For example, application owners can deploy a nonproduction instance of a heavily utilized database in the cloud and simulate peak activity to see how well the application performs. In fact, some companies like Load DynamiX have virtual testing appliances that can simulate application workloads and run them in the cloud to help IT planners determine exactly what their storage I/O throughput rates need to be. Then the virtual appliance can generate the load to see if the cloud provider's infrastructure is up to the task.

The all-flash cloud storage service provider could offer some interesting capabilities for those businesses that need a storage performance pressure relief valve. With many businesses mandating their IT organizations to cut costs and reduce capital spending, IT planners need to find creative ways to satisfy business needs without breaking the bank. By selectively bursting critical business application workloads into the cloud, it is possible to meet application service levels and keep costs in check. The key, however, is to make sure your provider has the ability to meet your needs as they change over time.

# Bare-metal cloud means more flexibility at a cost



## Businesses face the challenge of finding the right cloud for their needs. With the ability to customize software for unique app requirements, bare-metal cloud may be the best option.

In a crowded cloud market, differentiation is everything. Cloud service providers seek common themes to generate new customers and grow revenue. Bare-metal cloud is one such differentiator, offering flexibility and the ability to host high-performance applications. But is it right for your enterprise?

Unlike typical cloud services, bare-metal clouds come with hardware, not software. It has no operating system (OS), virtualization or applications. Enterprises need to configure the cloud platform themselves, which has its advantages and disadvantages.

Flexibility is one major advantage of bare-metal cloud's customization. Businesses with unique application requirements can configure the platform to meet their specific needs. Because of how the server is sequestered, bare-metal cloud can also offer better performance than traditional cloud services. Research shows that [bare-metal cloud servers](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240203392/Bare-metal-servers-in-the-cloud-aid-performance-compliance) run 10% to 50% faster than hypervisor-based, multi-tenant cloud platforms.

With multi-tenant cloud, companies put multiple virtualized workloads on a shared physical server to increase overall resource use. However, different apps compete for the same processor and memory resources. The worst-case scenario is that computing resources are not available when needed.

Virtualizing cloud workloads also takes a toll on performance. Hypervisor tax is the amount of processing capacity the hypervisor layer consumes. Despite virtualization, service providers improved the software layer to make it thinner. But hypervisors still consume a percentage of the server's available processing power. The tax negatively affects performance for workloads that require large amounts of capacity.

The hypervisor, like each additional software layer, delays the system. Even though these delays are only milliseconds, they create problems with high-I/O, sensitive workloads.

In a shared cloud service, workloads fluctuate; slower application response times occur when an app encounters a [noisy neighbor](http://searchaws.techtarget.com/news/2240209703/AWS-fends-off-bouncy-cloud-computing-performance-perception) or another customer gobbling up system resources. Bare-metal cloud only runs one application, which eliminates the noisy neighbor issue.

Bare-metal cloud also enables rapid deployment. Bare-metal servers can be deployed quickly because they lack much of the infrastructure software.

### ****Application use cases for bare-metal cloud**

High-volume, high-performance workloads and [big data applications](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240219702/Cloud-based-data-analytics-levels-the-BI-playing-field) are suited to bare-metal deployments. These apps are disk I/O-intensive, so traditional servers and storage systems struggle to keep up with these high volume and velocity requests.

Media encoding for user-generated content, such as social networking and video sharing, is a good application to run on a bare-metal cloud. When a user uploads a video, it must be transcoded into a common format for viewing. Transcoding software for audio and video is processor-intensive, which degrades performance if it's located on the same machine as the Web server or used in a multi-tenant environment.

[Compliance regulations](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/feature/Understanding-ITs-role-in-cloud-security-and-compliance) also push certain enterprises to use bare-metal clouds. Verticals such as finance, government and healthcare must follow strict guidelines for storing, managing and sharing data. Shared infrastructure, such as public cloud, creates uncertainty regarding data security because the customer does not control the infrastructure or the other apps. A bare-metal cloud gives enterprise IT more control over the data center infrastructure.

### ****High performance equals high prices**

Despite all of the benefits and use cases listed for bare-metal cloud, cost may deter the average enterprise from its use. Bare-metal cloud services generally are more expensive than hypervisor-based cloud services. Vendors cannot recoup infrastructure investments among a bevy of customers because the charges go solely to the firm using the bare-metal cloud.

Although many enterprises use bare-metal services for private cloud apps, a number of public cloud service providers are moving into the space. [IBM’s SoftLayer](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240225338/IBM-SoftLayer-a-few-pieces-short-of-a-finished-puzzle) is a bare-metal service that runs CentOS, Red Hat, FreeBSD and Ubuntu OSes; it bills customers on an hourly basis. [Rackspace OnMetal](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240223375/Rackspace-pushes-bare-metal-cloud-amid-shaky-future) is a single-tenant bare-metal product that uses OpenStack APIs.

# AWS fends off 'bouncy' cloud computing performance perception

## Some Amazon Web Services customers blame 'noisy neighbors' for fluctuating cloud performance, but AWS officials say that's not what's happening.

Amazon Web Services shops said they've seen fluctuating performance on the company's Elastic Compute Cloud due to "noisy neighbors," but Amazon officials said that's a misconception.

A "noisy neighbor" in the [context of cloud computing](http://www.theserverside.com/news/2240210976/Overprovisioning-A-costly-cloud-computing-mistake) refers to a co-tenant on a piece of virtualized server hardware that [hogs resources](http://searchaws.techtarget.com/answer/Can-I-silence-noisy-neighbor-and-restore-cloud-bandwidth), slowing other tenants' virtual machines down in the process.

"The Achilles' heel for Amazon is the noisy neighbor," said Devon Lazarus, cloud services manager for an electronic equipment manufacturer on the West Coast.

Lazarus said the key to avoiding this problem is to pick the largest appropriate [instance type](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/tip/Choosing-the-right-Amazon-EC2-instance-type) to run performance-sensitive applications -- that way, in theory, the application shares a server with fewer other machines.

"The micro and small instances are not for production," he said. "We usually use them for testing and validation, then move into larger instances."

Another Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) customer, who asked to remain anonymous, also said he has seen [the noisy neighbor problem](http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/tip/Navigate-noisy-neighbor-challenges-in-cloud-vs-colocation)when it comes to network bandwidth.

These comments came on the heels of a survey by [Cloud Spectator](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240208550/Cloud-computing-users-want-answers-during-AWS-reInvent), commissioned by AWS competitor Virtustream, which ranked [Amazon Web Services](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240209113/AWS-ventures-far-beyond-IaaS-with-latest-cloud-services) (AWS) at the bottom of a list of competitors in [cloud computing performance](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240208529/Rackspace-launches-cloud-computing-performance-surge-against-AWS). Since the survey was commissioned by a competitor, it is to be taken with a grain of salt, but it is also one data point in support of customers' perceptions about EC2 performance.

Meanwhile, AWS officials said that while performance may vary, there is no noisy neighbor problem in EC2.

"What customers are really reporting there is a difference in performance from one instance to another, but it's not due to other people [sharing the hardware]," said Matt Wood, general manager of data science for AWS.

Instead, Wood said, Amazon might have refreshed its host hardware, so customers might see an instance restart on a server with a faster processor and conclude that the previous host suffered from contention problems.

"At a high level, we have hard partitioning at the CPU level, and we provide [Provisioned IOPS]- and [Elastic Block Storage]-optimized instances to [ensure consistent IO performance](http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/answer/How-can-I-ensure-peak-cloud-storage-performance)," Wood said. "On C3 instances, we also have single-root IO virtualization, which enhances networking further."

But analysts say customers' observations have some merit.

"Noisy neighbor" is only supposed to apply to situations where resources are oversubscribed, which is typical for Web hosting and virtual private servers, said Carl Brooks, analyst with the 451 Group based in Boston. AWS does not oversubscribe, so this shouldn't happen.

"What happens instead is that other parts of the host system get overtaxed -- RAM, bandwidth, traffic to disk," Brooks said. "As AWS pointed out, they have additional for-pay services to mitigate that effect, but that doesn't change the user's experience. It's not technically a noisy neighbor, but it is your neighbors being too noisy overall."

Some customers at the show said [fluctuations in cloud computing performance](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240211236/AWS-C3-shortage-signals-thirst-for-cloud-computing-performance) must be expected from any service provider, and the appropriate response is just to spin up more instances.

"Spot instances are two cents apiece -- what do I care about having to spin up more?" said Brian Tarbox, a software engineer at Cabot Research, a financial data analysis firm based in Boston. "You have to assume failures happen and that there will be bouncy latency and throughput; you have to build systems that can handle those things."

# Eliminating Noisy Neighbors in the Public Cloud

# 避开公有云之中的坏邻居效应


An IaaS provider is using all-SSD arrays and storage QoS to ensure that some tenants can’t disrupt performance of others by overconsuming resources.

IaaS 厂商(虚机服务提供商)使用纯SSD磁盘组(all-SSD arrays),以及存储 QoS 来确保不会因为某些恶意用户的过度消费,而影响其他客户的服务性能。


One problem with multitenant public cloud environments is the "noisy neighbor" phenomenon, when one or more customers monopolize available resources and thus significantly degrade the performance of other customers' systems.

在多租户的公有云环境中,会存在一种严重的问题, 称为 "坏邻居效应"(noisy neighbor phenomenon), 当一个或多个客户过度使用了某种公共资源时, 就会明显损害到其他客户的系统性能。


One way to address this problem is via storage-based quality of service that provides defined service levels to all tenants. An infrastructure-as-a-service provider, CloudSigma, is using all-SSD arrays from SolidFire to create an architecture to eliminate noisy neighbors.

有一种解决方案,是通过基于存储的服务质量,为所有租户提供服务等级协议。IaaS厂商 CloudSigma, 使用 SolidFire 的纯固态硬盘组创建了一个能消除坏邻居效应的架构。


CloudSigma has decided to replace all of its Tier 1 primary storage hard disk arrays with SolidFire all-SSD arrays. In addition to this significant move, the company also offers solid-state drive storage at the same price as hard disk for the same capacity. How can CloudSigma do this when flash memory is more expensive on a per-unit basis than hard disk?

CloudSigma 决定用SolidFire的全SSD磁盘组来替代所有的一级主存储阵列. 此外, 该公司还提供和普通硬盘同容量同价格的固态硬盘. CloudSigma 为什么能用比硬盘昂贵得多的闪存来提供服务呢?


An all-flash array can have better economics than an all-disk storage array in private data centers when taking into account the total system, including servers, storage and software (especially software licensing costs), as attested to by IBM based on a Wikibon study. IaaS does not have all the software licensing cost advantage, but CloudSigma overcomes the loss leader costs of storage by selling more compute cycles.

所有的flash数组可以有更好的经济比私有数据中心的所有磁盘存储阵列时考虑到整个系统,包括服务器,存储和软件(特别是软件许可成本),是由IBM证明基于Wikibon研究.IaaS没有所有的软件许可成本优势,但CloudSigma克服失去领袖通过出售更多的计算周期的存储成本。


CloudSigma's profit margins on consumption of computing resources are greater than that of storage. Key customers, such as big science in Europe and big media in the United States, have burst requirements. Being able to house all of a big data set on SSD improves performance, which means things get done in a more timely (that is, valuable) manner, and the compute fees go to CloudSigma instead of to a competitor.

CloudSigma利润率的计算资源的消耗大于存储.关键客户,如大科学在欧洲和美国大媒体,有破裂的要求.能够房子的大数据集在SSD的性能得到了很大的提高,这就意味着事情做在一个更及时(有价值的),和计算费用去CloudSigma而不是一个竞争对手。


But the burst requirements of some customers may create noisy-neighbor problems for subscription customers with more traditional storage provisioning needs. CloudSigma needed an SSD-array supplier that could solve this noisy-neighbor QoS problem, and so it turned to SolidFire.

但是有些客户可能的破裂需求创建noisy-neighbor问题订阅客户与更传统的存储配置需求.CloudSigma需要一个SSD-array供应商可以解决这个noisy-neighbor QoS问题,所以它变成了SolidFire。


Solving the Noisy-Neighbor Problem

解决Noisy-Neighbor问题


With an IT product like a storage array, architecture encompasses both the hardware and software components that give the product its character and style. For example, an enterprise-class disk array is more than a just-a-bunch-of-disks offering. Among other features, it contains a controller that has one or more processors running a specialized operating system and software algorithms that manage RAM cache to improve overall performance.

与IT产品存储阵列,架构包含硬件和软件组件,产品个性和风格.例如,一个企业级磁盘阵列是一个多just-a-bunch-of-disks祭.等特性,它包含一个控制器,一个或多个处理器运行专门的操作系统和软件的算法管理RAM缓存来提高整体性能。


SolidFire's SF3010 and SF6010 appliances are controller-less, all-flash arrays where one node is 1U high, for an effective capacity of 12 Tbytes (with 10 128-Gbyte drives in an SF3010) and 24 Tbytes (with 256-Gbyte drives in an SF6010). The company's scale-out clustered architecture enables a single cluster of appliances to scale to more than 2 petabytes of effective capacity.

SolidFire SF3010和SF6010电器controller-less,所有的flash数组一个节点在哪里1 u高,的有效容量12 Tbytes(10 128 -千兆字节驱动器在SF3010)和24 Tbytes(256 -在SF6010千兆字节驱动器).公司的横向扩展集群架构允许单个集群设备规模超过2 pb有效的能力。


But the true power of SolidFire resides in its Element operating system, which manages all the functions of the array. That includes SolidFire Helix data protection to manage device failure without performance impact (a key element in meeting QoS commitments). SolidFire software also offers thin provisioning, deduplication and compression to get the most out of the available storage. For example, thin provisioning is necessary for elasticity in the cloud as allocated, but not-yet-used system resources, such as IOPS and gigabytes, can be made available on demand for peak load (that is, burst) requirements.

但SolidFire的真正威力驻留在其元素的操作系统,管理所有数组的函数.包括SolidFire螺旋数据保护管理设备故障没有性能影响(会议QoS承诺的一个关键因素).SolidFire软件还提供了自动精简配置,重复数据删除和压缩得到的可用的存储空间.例如,自动精简配置必要的弹性云中的分配,但尚未使用的系统资源,如IOPS,g,可以对高峰负荷需求(即破裂)的要求。


In a CloudSigma cloud, customers purchase both the gigabytes and IOPS necessary for a guaranteed minimum performance level for applications as a whole (and not just for the 5% of data that is traditionally considered performance-sensitive). This delivers predictable performance, but also means that SolidFire has to have some mechanisms that eliminate potential noisy-neighbor threats. The company achieves this through balanced load distribution, which eliminates hot spots that create unpredictable latency and performance virtualization that enables on-demand control of performance independent of capacity, as well as fine-grain volume control.

在一个CloudSigma云,客户购买g和IOPS保证最低性能水平所需应用程序作为一个整体(而不仅仅是传统上被认为是5%的数据 性能敏感的部分)。这提供可预测的性能,但也意味着SolidFire必须有一些机制,消除潜在的noisy-neighbor威胁.公司实现了通过平衡负载分布,消除热点,创造不可预测的延迟和性能虚拟化,使按需控制性能无关的容量,以及精密音量控制。


Key to all this is the use of a REST-based API that delivers multitenant provisioning, reporting and performance isolation. The key word is "isolation." Each cloud tenant needs to be assured that its reserved resources will be available as guaranteed. That means SolidFire has to find the necessary physical resources when they are needed, even though the customer has been allocated resources on a physical basis.

这一切的关键是使用基于rest的API,提供了多租户供应、报告和性能隔离。关键词是“隔离.“每个云租户需要保证其预留资源将提供保证.这意味着SolidFire必须找到必要的物理资源时需要的,即使客户已经分配资源在物理的基础上。


Altogether, SolidFire delivers not only predictable performance but also the necessary reliability, data protection and security characteristics that enable the running of business- and mission-critical applications. Though a number of enterprises might not want to entrust those systems to a public cloud, SolidFire's offerings make that decision based on reasons other than technology considerations. And CloudSigma's customer base, which includes CERN (a stickler when it comes to technology and security requirements), would argue that not everyone feels that way.

完全,不仅SolidFire提供可预测的性能也是必要的可靠性,数据保护和安全特性,使业务和关键任务应用程序的运行.虽然很多企业可能不希望委托这些系统公共云,SolidFire的产品做决定基于技术因素以外的原因.和CloudSigma的客户群,其中包括欧洲核子研究中心(固执己见时,技术和安全需求),认为并不是每个人都感觉如此而已。


Note also that the level of guaranteed QoS SolidFire promises is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with all-hard disk arrays, mainly because they are electromechanical products versus an all-electronic SSD array. Rather than getting into details, suffice to say that managing available IOPS is more straightforward with SSDs than with hundreds or thousands of moving actuator arms. And that's one reason that all-flash arrays will eventually prevail over all-disk arrays when QoS is a strict requirement.

还要注意保证QoS SolidFire承诺的水平是困难的,如果不是不可能的话)与所有硬盘磁盘阵列来实现,主要因为他们是机电产品,而不是一台SSD数组.而不是进入细节,我想说的是,管理可用的IOPS比与直接用ssd成百上千的致动器臂移动.和这是一个原因,所有的flash数组最终将战胜所有磁盘阵列QoS时严格要求。


Mesabi Musings

Mesabi沉思


The IT industry does not officially declare "The Year of..." awards, but if it did for storage, 2013 might be called "The Year of All-Flash Arrays." IBM in its recently announced flash initiative stood as a "Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval" for all-flash arrays in data centers based on a purely economic analysis.

IT行业并没有正式宣布“年”…”奖项,但如果做存储,2013年被称为“今年所有的flash的数组.“IBM在其最近宣布flash倡议站作为一个“好管家批准印章”所有的flash中的数组数据中心基于纯粹的经济分析。


CloudSigma and SolidFire have extended that point to public cloud infrastructures. In a multitenant cloud, economics is a critically important consideration, of course, but so is being able to provide a guaranteed QoS. Without predictable performance (and that's not just for performance-sensitive data, but all data on a day-to-day basis), customers cannot commit to a public cloud.

CloudSigma和SolidFire扩展,指出公共云基础设施.在一个多租户云,经济学是一门非常重要的考虑因素,当然,但能够提供一个保证QoS.没有可预测的性能(不仅对性能敏感的数据,但日常所有数据),客户不能提交公共云。


SolidFire eliminates the noisy-neighbor QoS problem, and CloudSigma attests to the technical and economical value of this approach with its full commitment to all-SSD SolidFire arrays for primary storage. To achieve this, SolidFire has created a sophisticated architecture that provides differentiation in the same sense that an enterprise-class disk array is much more than just a bunch of disks. From an economic performance and QoS manageability perspective, all-flash arrays now command the high ground for Tier 1 primary storage arrays.

SolidFire消除了noisy-neighbor QoS问题,和CloudSigma证明了这种方法的技术经济价值的全面承诺all-SSD SolidFire主存储器阵列.为了达到这个目标,SolidFire创造了一个复杂的架构,提供差异化在同样的意义上,企业级磁盘阵列不仅仅是一堆磁盘.从经济性能和QoS管理角度来看,现在所有的flash阵列命令一级主存储器阵列的高地。


We all knew that flash's time was coming; what should be apparent to all is that time is now.

我们都知道,闪存大放光彩的时代到来了,当然,现在就是。


Neither CloudSigma nor SolidFire is a client of David Hill and the Mesabi Group.


无论是CloudSigma还是SolidFire大卫·希尔是一个客户端和Mesabi组。
